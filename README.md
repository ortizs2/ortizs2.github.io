# ortizs2.github.io
My name is Seth my username is ortizs2 and my email address is snortiz@my.waketech.edu. My GitHub is a student account where I plan to make projects for my class CTI-110. The repository I have created is an empty repository named with my user name followed by ".github.io" with the only fine inside of it being the README.MD. The steps to get here were to create my account and add a readme file. Next, I cloned the original repository, edited the readme file, and committed changes. After committing changes finally pushed my changes to the origin.
